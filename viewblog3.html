      “My Spanish Adventure” is a wonderful idea for a blog.  Will Peach did something that many people dream of, and that’s to leave the 9-5 and go traveling.He followed his heart to Spain to become fluent in Spanish and learn more about the country.  His blog posts read like a close friend sending you notes from abroad, but each one has something valuable about the country and the language.  He shares stories about his experiences and some of the joys and challenges of learning a foreign tongue, some of which will be familiar to readers.Blog posts are categorized into four sections: immersion in Spain, what to see in Spain, save money in Spain and is Spanish hard to learn?  As you can imagine with someone who’s traveling through the country, the range of topics is immense, everything from tourist information such as great places to surf to essential how-to guides.  Will is an engaging and entertaining writer and some of the posts are in Spanish.
